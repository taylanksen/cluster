2.36,2.38,Could you give me some more details about the image?,2.39,3.06,"OK.  It was. So the hair brush was pretty much brown. So like a wooden hair brush. It's got the little balls at the end. I guess it's more like a female hair brush. I don't know if male hair brushes really have those, but usually like when they are hair brushes there are kind of like little balls on the top and then kinds, just like that."

4.15,4.17,Are there any other objects in the image?,4.18,4.33,"Yes. It was on top of a desk. So you could see the or, not like desk, but, dresser. So you could see the wood below it, a little bit of the mirror behind it. There weren't too many other objects on the dresser."
4.37,4.41,Can you tell me anyting about the background in the image?,4.42,4.53,Mm. I mean you couldn't really see behind the mirror. You can only see like a little bit of the mirror so mostly it was just a reflection back on the top of it.
4.55,4.57,Could you tell me where you think the image was photographed?,4.58,5.08,Mm. Probably a bedroom. I assumed less people are putting their dressers in other rooms. I don't think it was like a studio or anyway.
5.09,5.14,Can you tell me about the lighting that goes on with your studio things?,5.16,5.39,"Right, yeah. So like it wasn't, um, like a very general light. You could tell the light was coming from one direction. I feel like the dresser was power, not dress. Yeah, dresser. I don't know why I keep wanting to call it a desk. I guess because I'm sitting at one. Anyway. You could tell that it was on like the right side of the room because the lighting was from the left. So I'm pretty sure there would be a wall to the right."
