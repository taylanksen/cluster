1.11,1.12,Give me more details about it?,1.13,1.41,"Yeah, well so the foreground ah, is basically you know, you got the railroad tracks. And then starting a couple of feet off the end of them you've got grass with a number of flowers and gives you some purple and white. And a little bit of yellow, sort of in the foreground of the painting in the very bottom front. Ah. And then you have basically just like a distinct row of trees kind of behind the train, in the back."

2.34,2.35,And what were the colors?,2.37,2.54,"Ah. So let's see here. Some white purple in the flowers in the front. Ah, and then you had like sort of dark grey iron color on the tracks. And, that was the train."
3.06,3.1,What time of day was it? Was it like a bright day or?,3.13,3.25,"Ah. Well, the sun was in the sky, like the part of the sky that I could see. But it seems like it was probably directly over head because everything was really bright. There weren't really any noticeable shadows."

4.25,4.29,Could you tell how long the train was or was it just like the head of itself?,4.3,4.44,"Um, no it wasn't, it wasn't so head on that I couldn't make an estimate although my sense of space is bad. It seems that about ten cars worth."
4.49,4.54,Do you think the tracks go through the trees or they were just like there?,4.54,4.57,Oh. Yeah. It definitely was coming out. Trees on either side were coming out from.
