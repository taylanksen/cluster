1.14,1.16,What type of computer system are you using?,1.17,1.18,A laptop
1.21,1.23,Is it a Mac or PC?,1.24,1.24,PC.
1.28,1.31,Can you tell me whether I am wearing glasses or not.,1.31,1.33,You are. Still.
1.35,1.37,What color clothes did you wear yesterday?,1.38,1.39,Blue.
1.41,1.42,What is twelve plus nineteen?,1.43,1.46,"Oh, God. Thirty one."
1.5,1.53,"Did you ever steal anything in your whole life, and if so, what was it?",1.54,1.55,I don't think so.
2,2.01,What was your image?,2.02,2.03,It was a mountain.
2.07,2.1,Could you give me some more details about the image?,2.11,2.27,"It wasn't a real mountain. It was a painting of a mountain. There were three. Is that still considered a mountain or is it a range at three? How many does it have to be before it's a range? OK. So, mountain range."
2.37,2.42,Could you give me some more details about the image? So you said it was three? They have the same height?,2.43,2.54,"No, they were varied. Tallest in the middle, the one in front was a little bit shorter, and then like the one behind it was very much shorter, skewed."
2.56,3.01,You said it was a painting. Would you say it was a professional painter or was it an amateur paint?,3.02,3.13,"Ah. I don't know if that would like sell for five hundred dollars but I'm sure somebody would probably like pay a hundred for it. Like, they might like to hang it somewhere nice."
3.22,3.25,If there were something to count in the image. What would it be? Swaht would be the count?,3.26,3.28,The mountains. There were three.
3.31,3.34,And is there anything else in the picture worth noting?,3.35,3.42,Ah. There is sky in the backgrond. It's more top of the mountain rather than full mountain. So sky. A little bit of cloud.
3.48,3.5,Is it a day shot or a evening shot?,3.51,4,"Ah. It's probably a little afternoon. Like the colors were cool, they weren't very like sun setting or sun rising."
4.07,4.1,Could you describe to me the colors in the image? All the colors that you remember.,4.11,4.54,Ok. So the mountain is primarily brown at the top. It starts lightning until it gets to a white so snow. Ah. The one or the two in front are a little bit more saturated than the one in the back. It's a little more desaturated because it's further away so it's a little bit more faded. Ah. Primarily it's all like natural colors. Blue sky. White clouds. Ah. Nothing really green on it or anything. So it's pretty much like a rock mountain rather than like tree mountain. There is an official term for that. I don't know.
4.28,5.02,Where do you think the image was painted?,5.03,5.17,En. I would say if it was here. West coast. Because on the east coast most of our mountains are very treey and I think the west coast has more rocky. Well they had the rocky mountain.
5.36,5.37,Did you see any trees in the picture?,5.38,5.38,No.
5.4,5.42,Did you see like a valley or anything?,5.43,5.54,No. It looks like it was cut off before it got that low. It was mostly just the peaks of the mountain. Probably they go about like three quarters the way up with the top quarter of the picture being the sky.
5.57,6.02,There is a blue sky with some clouds in it and rock at the top?,6.03,6.03,En.
