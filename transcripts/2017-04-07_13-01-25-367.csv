0.53,0.55,Could you tell me what image it was?,1.01,2.01,"All right , my image was an acrylic painting of a mountain. Um. No discernible environment around it like the tree from the previous test. Um. But it was a, um, like a square painting. Ah. One mountain um, like ah, Mount Everest. It had a snow capped peak blue and purple hues down the sides. Um. And it took up um, about like two thirds of the way up the canvas. Ah. But um, no visible tree line beneath. It looked as if a ring of clouds were at the bottom of the mountain so this thing must be much taller, um, than the canvas could show. Um. And there weren't any clouds in the sky. No clouds above the cloud ring beneath the tree, beneath the mountain so it's ah, so it's, it's really high up. There were no trees visible."
2.1,2.11,It has a little peak?,2.12,2.31,"The, the mountain peak was shown and was snow capped but the mountain looks tall. Um, based on the context clues. It appeared larger than the image could show like beneath. Kind of like an iceberg. It was um, really large going down because there was clouds covering around the, the top of this peak."
2.34,2.35,Were there any other things?,2.36,3.14,"There weren't any clouds or birds or animals. There were no trees on it. It looked like just a, just a rocky mountain. Um, well. There were hints of blue and purple throughout the rocks as you got further down towards the clouds. It started to grey out because of the water mist. Um, but um. Of course the white snow cap with hues of grey in there to show depth in the snow. But other than that, um, it was mostly a cool colored image. Um. No reds, oranges or yellows."
3.22,3.23,Do you think the image was photographed or drawn?,3.24,3.27,"I, I, I, I think it was painted. It looked like an acrylic painting."
3.3,3.31,And the lighting in your image?,3.32,3.4,"The ah. The lighting was ah, it, it looked about midday so there were no reflection hues like yellows from the morning or orange from the afternoon."
3.51,3.54,Was there any form of life in the image?,3.55,4.2,"Um. Not that I saw. If it was there I didn't notice it but um. The thing, thing is pretty damn big. I mean, if we're talking like um, like dead tree or so, I possibly didn't see it because brown could be hidden very well by the ah, by the darker hues on this thing. There was, it was a lot of detail for a mountain. Yep."
4.24,4.25,Could you describe again?,4.29,5.21,"Well. Envison a square, envision a square canvas. There was a ah, mountain, um, and it reached the top of the peak, was two thirds of the way up the canvas going down where the rocky sides in like, much like a pyramid almost but um, so it was divided in like a v versus um, negative space. It was a clear sky above. There was a, um, level of clouds, a ring of clouds around, ah, where it came off the campus, canvas at the bottom. Sorry. And um, the mountain was painted in dark hues of blue purple um, and um, and grey going down. Um with I didn't notice any signs of life. The image was pretty small."
5.28,5.3,"No animals, no human being?",5.3,5.31,I didn't see them.
5.37,5.39,What were the corners of the image?,5.39,5.51,"Well, the, the top left and top right corners were, um, just sky blue, and the bottom ah, left and right hand corners were um, where the mountain started fading into the clouds."
