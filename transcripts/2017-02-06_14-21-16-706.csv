0.15,0.16,Am I wearing glasses or not.,0.17,0.18,No.
0.25,0.26,What was your image?,0.27,0.41,"My image was a cluster of five like flowers with golden centers near the center of the picture frame. Ah, and behind them was a likely largely blurred out green  shrubbery.  "
0.42,0.44,Could you give me some more details about the image?,0.45,1.22,"Ah, so each of the flowers had five petals, and the golden faded out into the pedals but each pedal was very distinct, and they overlap. Kind of like one was over the next one which is over the next one, so over the next one. So they are like very delicate and pristine. The bine was a darker bay color that branch out from the stage, right off the image and then was hidden by the flowers. But you could see like then fronts holding up the flowers. The flowers were directed towards stage left, and then slightly at an angle towards me maybe thirty five degrees from stage left."
1.26,1.29, Were there any other objects in the image besides the flower and the shrubbery?,1.31,1.34,Not really. The shrubbery was that entire in the background.
1.35,1.38,Were the flowers in like a vase or something?,1.4,1.53,"Like I said they came from the bay colored stem, protruded from stage right. Ah, they took up the most of the image so other than a couple of maybe millimeters to the top and bottom and left of image, there was really just flowers."
1.54,1.58,Can you see the stem of the flowers from the angle?,1.59,2.14,Like I said that only the one stem was really visible. There are a couple of very small fronts holding up some of the flowers that was visible but for his part they were less visible. The stem was incredibly thin and they were only visible for a couple of the flowers in that entire leaf.
2.15,2.17,What were like the primary colors of the image?,2.18,2.4,"Yeah, the primary colors were mainly two. One was this pasta white of the flowers and the other was this like, Ah, emerald green for the shurbbery that was like largely blurred out to darker shade colors. Ah. The flowers and folders were seemed to be primarily white because the golden was so faint. It was really concentrated to the center of the flowers."
2.45,2.47,Are there any other objects in the image?,2.48,2.57,"It appeared to be a photograph but it could have been a very high quality painted drawing. Ah, but it did look like either digitally created or like a photograph."
3.02,3.04,Could you tell what time of day it was?,3.05,3.33,"It appeared to be like the middle of the day could have been high. But they were definitely not significant Ah shadows. There is no discoloration that would appear to be like later in the day, and the shadows that did exist were all beneath the leaves of the shrubbery where was white off. So it's clear that the shadows came from a vertical presence of light and not from like, that was angled to create shadows that were, Ah, created from other objects in the picture."
3.39,3.46,"There was nothing else in this image besides the flowers and the shrubbery. There was no like grass in between, no ground, no insect, nothing?",3.47,4.29,"No. I really don't think so. Just these six flowers that took up the vast majority of the screen. That big colored stem from the right. A tiny bit of stem behind the flowers the blurred out shrubbery that covered the entirety of the background. A couple of swatches could have been shadows. The one thing that perhaps otherwise not existed in the photo was the really tiny stems that were visible. Or I think the flower for this to the left and one of the flowers further upper left hand corner always stage left of course. Was like a tiny ball on a couple of the stems where it looked like that was a bulbous piece of the stem or maybe a flower hadn't been plotted yet. But, those really it."
4.36,4.38,How many flowers did you say there were again?,4.39,4.4,There were six flowers.
4.41,4.43,How many petals did you have roughly?,4.43,4.58,"Each one had five petals like I said. Ah, let's see. I think two of the flowers really angled towards me, like twenty five to forty degrees towards me. And the others were angled really just stage left so."
