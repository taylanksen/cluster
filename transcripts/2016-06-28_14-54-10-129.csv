1.2,1.21,What type of computer system are you using?,1.22,1.29,"I am using a Windows ten computer. I mean, it's a desktop. I don't know which one you needed."
1.34,1.36,Am I wearing glasses or not?,1.36,1.37,No.
1.42,1.44,What color clothes did you wear yesterday?,1.46,1.56,"Ah. I don't know. I own a lot of shirts in this color so I would go this color. Yeah. Redish maroonish, they all look like red. I have school colors."
1.57,1.59,What is twelve plus nineteen?,2,2.01,Thirty one.
2.04,2.08,"Did you ever steal anything in your whole life, and if so, what was it?",2.09,2.23,"No. Wait yes. I, I stole a stored animal from some dude that was picking on my friend and trying to harass her. Anf it's mine and is still mine. I did steal from some dude's bag but not a store or anything."
2.31,2.32,What was your image?,2.34,2.44,"Ah. My image was a dragon head. It was like mounted on a wall sticking out. It's kind of like the Chinese dragon style, not really European style of all white and scaly and patchy."
2.47,2.49,Could you give me some more details?,2.51,3.17,"Um. I think I gave you what I actually remembered. Her patch was like a little bit black and redish. and it looked kind of like it had been there for hundreds of years almost because it was decaying, it was like somebody fucked up preserving the head or it was just there that long so that the reservation was no longer good for it. Um. It had its tongue sticking out and most, most of the dragons was like. I know that his eyes were visible, but they were pretty, pretty close to that color. I think they were grey."
3.24,3.29,If there were something to count in the image. What would it be? What would it be the count?,3.31,3.42,"I don't even know like how to count. It was a single dragon head and mounted on a wall. It was just one, one, one dragon head. Thankfully it's not a dragon killer's home."
3.44,3.46,Are there any other objects in the image?,3.46,3.53,Ah. No. Maybe the wall and the plaque like. That's really about it. It was mainly the dragon head.
3.56,3.57,What color was the image?,3.58,4.22,"Ah. So the wall was I think just standard greyish. And the um, the dragon head was pretty much that it was just that. It was the white dragon head with all those colors I descirbed before. And the back was wooden so I think it was, it was kind of red without mostly distractive about the dragon. It was cool."
4.26,4.27,Did it have eyes?,4.27,4.28,"Yes, it did."
4.29,4.34,Were they looking forward? Were they looking to the sides? What was the position?,4.35,4.48,I mean it was kind of position because it was a snapshot of the head. The head was just kind of facing forward away from you. But like forward towards the side shot. So like where my eyes are you see in my video right now.
4.5,4.53,Did it look like happy or mad?,4.54,5.18,"I mean not really. It was dead. It was, it was a dragon head mounted on a wall. I am assuming the dragon is not alive. That's what I am saying. Like the wall was like a wooden plaque. Like it's, it's a dead dragon. I was glad there was only one because I was, I was scared if looking to like dragon killer's home where stores. Oh, god. How many things are in the background. But it's just the wall thankfully."
5.21,5.22,How would you describe the background again?,5.23,5.33,It was just a wall. Like the wall with like a little plaque. But that kind of was like there's got to be something else here because a dragon head is pretty random. I was not expecting that kind of thing.
5.4,5.43,Why do you think they mounted the dragon head?,5.43,5.53,"Because there were jerks that kill dragons apparently. I'm, I'm kind of selfy. Last time I played DND I had a really good pet dragon. So i just like, what if that was my pet dragon."
5.54,5.56,You would treat with respect instead of trying to kill it and mount it?,5.57,6.04,I mean like. I might try to mount it but as a writer. Not like mount its head on a wall. Because that's evil. Bad.
