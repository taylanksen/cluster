1.05,1.08,What color clothes did you wear yesterday?,1.11,1.12,Blue.
1.14,1.16,What is twelve plus nineteen?,1.17,1.24,"Twelve plus nineteen is, I'm sorry, thirty one."
1.25,1.29,"Did you ever steal anything in your whole life, if so, what was it?",1.31,1.35,When I was a kid I think I stole a piece of candy at the grocery store but I would let it go.
1.4,1.41,What was your image?,1.42,1.58,"My image, um. It was um, a scene. It was like a sunset scene. It kind of looked like the US capital although I don't think it was. I'm not exactly sure where it was but it was, it was like a river with some bridges. Looked like bridges over it."
1.59,2.02,Could you give me some more details about the image?,2.02,2.12,"It was really colorful. Um, it was pretty beautiful. Um, it was really tiny but I believe it was an actual photograph not like a painting."
2.16,2.19,If there were something to count in the image. What would it be? What would it be the count?,2.21,2.28,"It would probably be the arches and the bridge, let me think, probably about six arches maybe."
2.3,2.32,Are there any objects in the image?,2.33,2.47,Well I mean as I said there's the river and there's the dome in the background that reminded me of like the us capital. I don't think it was though. I've never been to the US capital but it looked almost like it was in France so.
2.48,2.49,What are the colors in the image?,2.5,2.58,"There was, there were pink, blue um, and it was, like I said, sunset things. The sunset was really pink looking."
3.01,3.02,Could you tell me about the background in the image?,3.04,3.22,"Um. The background I mean, it was, it was like a pink and like a pink sunset I guess that's the background. It's, it's kind of like a city scene, but not like you know, skyscrappers and things. If that makes sense."
3.26,3.29,Do you think where the image was photographed?,3.3,3.46,"Like I said, it, it reminded me of the state like National capitial. Um. Or like here in Arkansas we have, we have a capital that's like that too. Bur it didn't look like that to me. Um. It looked like maybe something that was European."
3.53,3.56,What were the sizes of things inside the image?,3.58,4.23,"Ah. The actual building in the background was not huge. That's one reason why I didn't think it was actually US capital. The bridges looked pretty big, I mean you know the bridge I saw with all the arches. And ,Ah, you know one reason why I thought it was an european type of image because everything was very artistic if you know I'm saying. Like something you would see in Paris or somewhere."
4.34,4.37,If there were one main thing in the image.,4.37,4.47,It would be the river. Yeah I mean the capital is pretty prominent in the background but the river is really kind of first and foremost.

4.57,4.58,Is it like a canal?,4.58,5.05,"Yeah, yeah. Like a canal river exactly. And not, not so small that would be considered a stream and you couldn't walk across it like you are on the bridge."
5.09,5.11,Did the color seem artifical?,5.11,5.23,"They did. You, you know, it, it looked to me like it was probably a real photo. But if it was a real photo i'm sure somebody used like filters of some sort."
5.29,5.3,Why should I believe you?,5.31,5.42,"Because I'm a truth person. Um, I am telling you the truth that is really what I saw,so. It was a very tiny image so I'm sorry if my descriptions aren't great but I am telling you the truth."
