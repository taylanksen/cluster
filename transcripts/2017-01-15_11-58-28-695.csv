I went to the grocery store in Atlanta which is where I grew up and we were the checkout line and I wanted some gum and my mom said no and I grabbed them anyhow nondetective in my shorts and I made it all the way to our car port and then I got busted when I got out of the car. Because they didn't quite stay put. I didn't have pockets. I put them in the waistband and they kind of fell through the leg. And um, so yeah I had to go back and return them to the manager. I didn't get arrested or anything. Thank God."

There were, there were two daisies that were white and sort of in the background and then there were, there was this plant almost like a vine that had these three or two tulippy things on it. And the tulippy things were like pink orange and red. And then there were these two sort of butterfly things that were flying around the tulippy things. Um. One of the butterflies had blue wings and the other one I can't remember. It may have been a moth actually. I can't remember. But the wings were of the other one. I can't, I can't remember but also, oh, also the tulippy things had this sort of like white light around them so it felt very sort of like fairy talish."
2.45,2.47,Could you give me some more details about the image?,3.06,3.33,"Um. Not really, I mean. That's what I saw. I saw the two daisies. One was a little taller than the other one, um, and a little bigger. And they were white and they were sort of in the background. And then there was these tulippy things with um, orange pink and red.  And each tulippy thing had a little bit of white light, sort of around it. And then there were these two sort of butterfly things flying towards it."

4.02,4.06,What kind of drawing it looks like? Is sketching or oil painting?,4.09,4.32,"Um. It didn't seem like an oil painting.

4.36,4.38,Was there too much light on the room?,4.42,5.06,"It wasn't, it didn't, I didn't get the sense that it took place in a room. Like there weren't enough the picture was just a focus picture of, you know, the things that I described and it looked almost like it was in a field or something. Um. And I guess maybe the background might have been a little dark. But whoever created the picture definitely emphasized this sort of like little white around the, the tulippy things."
